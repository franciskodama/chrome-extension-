### Hi there! I'm Francis Kodama! ðŸ‘‹

## WELCOME TO MY CHROME EXTENSION PROJECT. ðŸ‘»

<hr />

# this.Project ðŸ“–

It's a Chrome extension that allows you to save a URL so you can visit it later.

## Why?

The goal is to focus on what you really need to do every day to get shit done. If you see something interesting, just save it and check it out when you have time. Simple as that!
</br>
</br>

## How?

Simply click on the icon to open the Chrome extension modal, click on Save Tab, and that's it. In two clicks, you are back in full focus.
</br>
</br>

## Good to know:

This Chrome Extension saves your data (URL) locally, so you can lose your URLs if you clean your browser data.
